## 🔍 Overview

A comprehensive Python-based security scanning tool built as part of the Georgia Tech Cybersecurity program. This tool demonstrates advanced security assessment capabilities, professional coding practices, and real-world security testing methodologies.

## 🌟 Key Features

### Core Scanning Engine
- **Port Scanning**: Customizable port range scanning with stealth options
- **Service Detection**: Advanced service and version fingerprinting
- **OS Detection**: Operating system identification and analysis
- **Security Analysis**: Vulnerability assessment and risk evaluation

### Security & Reliability
- **Input Validation**: Robust validation for all user inputs
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management system
- **Logging**: Detailed activity logging for security auditing
- **Testing**: Extensive test coverage with pytest

## 🔄 Project Evolution

### 1. Basic Scanner (`main`)
```python
# Example Usage:
scanner = SecurityScanner()
results = scanner.scan_ports("127.0.0.1", "80-443")
```
- Base port scanning functionality
- Service identification
- Basic security checks

### 2. Enhanced Features

#### 🔒 Vulnerability Detection (`feature/vulnerability-detection`)
```python
# Advanced Vulnerability Scanning
scan_results = scanner.check_vulnerabilities(target_ip)
```
- CVE database integration
- Real-time security alerts
- Risk assessment scoring

#### 📊 Advanced Reporting (`feature/reporting`)
```python
# Generate Comprehensive Reports
scanner.generate_report(format='pdf')  # Supports: pdf, html, json
```
- Professional PDF reports
- Interactive HTML dashboards
- Data visualization
- Export capabilities

#### 🛡️ Security Analysis (`feature/security-analysis`)
```python
# Security Configuration Analysis
security_score = scanner.analyze_security(target)
```
- Configuration auditing
- Best practice checking
- Hardening recommendations

#### 🌐 Network Mapping (`feature/network-mapping`)
```python
# Network Topology Visualization
network_map = scanner.generate_network_map()
```
- Visual network diagrams
- Service dependency mapping
- Traffic flow analysis
